# Hyperparameter_tuning_Wine_Dataset

### Dataset
The dataset is the Wine quality dataset from the UCI machine learning Repository [Link]('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Explore-AI/Public-Data/master/Data/classification_sprint/winequality.csv')

### Objective
- Develop a Support Vector machine learning model. 
- Apply hyperparameter tuning to improve the model.
- Evaluate model performance with tuned hyperparameters.

### Key Insights 
- The SVM model is highly effective for this binary classification task, as evidenced by the high accuracy (>96%) before and after tuning.
- Hyperparameter tuning using a limited grid search on C and gamma improved model performance, increasing accuracy from 96.37% to 96.49% and reducing log loss from 1.254 to 1.212.
